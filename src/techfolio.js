I am also committed to both personal and professional growth learning from any situation in which i find myself. Backend and AI technology are stacks i'm very interested in learning. I am currently getting acquainted with more backend technologies while strengthening my ReactJs library skills.

  Research, where i can apply my skills and work with enthusiastic team members, is what i want. As long as i collaborate with people who build on my interest in the field of technology, I can overcome every hurdle
    
    Cheers, you now know about me`,
